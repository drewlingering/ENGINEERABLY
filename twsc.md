# Thermochemical Water-Splitting Cycles

## Overview
Thermochemical water-splitting cycles use heat to drive the endothermic reaction of water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen. The general reaction can be expressed as follows:

### Basic Reaction
H₂O(l) ↔ H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g)

## Key Thermochemical Cycles

### 1. Sulfur-Iodine Cycle
This cycle involves three main reactions:
1. Absorption of Iodine:
   2 H₂O(l) + 2 I₂(g) → 4 HI(g)
2. The decomposition step:
   2 HI(g) → H₂(g) + I₂(g)
3. Oxidation of HI:
   2 HI(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(l) + I₂(g)

### 2. Zinc-Oxide Cycle
This cycle consists of the following steps:
1. Thermochemical reaction:
   2 ZnO(s) + 2 H₂O(g) → 2 Zn(g) + 2 OH⁻(g)
2. Reduction step:
   2 Zn(g) + O₂(g) → 2 ZnO(s)

### Summary
The efficiency of these cycles can vary based on the thermodynamic conditions and the materials used in each step. Attention to detail in the chemical equations is essential for understanding the processes involved in these cycles.
