|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lignocellulosic    | Wood chips, pellets, sawdust, straw, husks, stalks, miscanthus, switchgrass | Chars and gasifies under heat; behaves like a solid; moisture strongly affects ignition and stability | Medium–high             | Moderate ash; can form clinker if minerals (e.g. silica, alkali) are high                        | Smoke and particulates if wet or under‑aired; NOₓ from high‑temp zones; generally low sulphur       | Forestry residues, sawmills, timber yards, farms, energy crops                                       | Very good: matches “slow‑pyrolysis/char + vapour” pattern; needs ash handling and moisture tolerance |
| Hemicellulosic     | Corn stover, bagasse, soft crop residues                  | Decomposes at lower temperatures; releases volatiles early; less dense, more friable         | Medium                  | Often higher ash than clean wood; ash is lighter and more easily entrained in flue gas           | Higher fine particulates; can smoke if under‑fired; still generally low sulphur                     | Sugar mills, grain farms, bioethanol plants, agro‑processing                                         | Good: easy to devolatilise; device must manage light, fluffy fuel and higher fly‑ash                 |
| Lignin‑rich        | Bark, paper‑mill residues, dried black liquor solids      | Resinous/tarry behaviour; high aromatic content; chars strongly; closer to tar than to clean wood | Medium–high             | Can produce sticky deposits; slagging and fouling risk on hot surfaces                           | Dense smoke if poorly burned; higher PAH content; still often lower sulphur than fossil tars        | Pulp & paper industry, sawmills, forestry processing                                                 | Very good conceptually: behaviour similar to bitumen/tar; needs good high‑temp zone and cleaning     |
| Lipid‑based (solid/semi‑solid) | Waste cooking fats, tallow, palm stearin, solid algal lipids | Melt → flow → vaporise → burn; at ambient may be waxy or solid; needs pre‑heating for consistency | High                    | Low ash; main issue is soot and deposits from incomplete vaporisation                            | Can be smoky and sooty if not fully vaporised; low ash but high unburned HC risk if mishandled      | Food industry, restaurants, slaughterhouses, biodiesel side‑streams, algae facilities                | Strong fit: device already contemplates viscous/tarry feeds; needs controlled melt and vapour phase  |
| Processed biomass (torrefied, briquettes, biochar) | Torrefied pellets, densified briquettes, biochar, “bio‑coal” | Stable, coal‑like; high fixed carbon; predictable grind/size; burns like low‑grade coal       | Medium–high             | Ash depends on source; torrefied fuels often have manageable ash; biochar leaves significant char | Particulates and NOₓ similar to low‑grade coal if over‑fired; sulphur usually lower than fossil coal | Biomass processing plants, waste‑to‑energy, carbon‑negative projects, rural fuel producers           | Excellent: uniform, predictable, easy to feed; ideal for commercialisation as a “universal” solid fuel |
| Digestate solids & mixed residues | Dried digestate, manure solids, mixed organic waste fractions | Moisture highly variable; can behave like low‑grade biomass/peat; may cake or crust          | Low–medium              | Often high ash; risk of slagging and fouling; mineral content highly variable                    | Higher particulates; odour compounds; NOₓ and some acid gases depending on composition              | Biogas plants, farms, municipal organic waste streams                                                | Possible but challenging: device must be tolerant of high ash, variable quality, and fouling         |
| Bitumen‑like / tarry bio‑residues | Lignin concentrates, pitch, heavy biorefinery residues       | Semi‑solid or viscous; softens then flows; slow to ignite; decomposes to vapours + coke      | High                    | Coke/char formation; sticky deposits; requires robust hot‑surface and cleaning strategy          | Heavy smoke and soot if under‑aired; high PAH content; low ash but dirty flue gas if mishandled     | Advanced biorefineries, pulp/paper, specialty chemical plants                                       | Very strong conceptual match: same handling class as bituminous oil sands; needs high‑temp, staged air |

| Lipid‑based        | Clustered around food and processing hubs           | Avoids dumping fats/oils; high energy density per unit mass            | If poorly managed, odour and smoke; upstream land‑use (e.g. palm) issues  | “Convert waste fats and solid oils into clean, controllable process heat.”                  |
| Processed biomass  | Manufactured fuels; higher price but predictable    | Enables high‑efficiency, low‑emission biomass systems                  | Energy and cost to process; feedstock sourcing still matters              | “Drop‑in solid fuel for multi‑fuel devices—predictable, easy to ship and store.”            |
| Digestate & mixed  | Very low or negative cost; disposal challenge       | Closes nutrient and carbon loops; reduces landfill and open dumping    | High ash, odour, variable composition; potential contaminants             | “Turn problematic digestate and organic residues into usable heat with tolerant hardware.”  |
| Bitumen‑like bio‑residues | Niche, site‑specific; often a liability to dispose of | Converts hazardous or awkward residues into energy under controlled conditions | High PAH and smoke risk if mishandled; requires strong governance         | “Specialist capability: safely utilise tarry bio‑residues that others can’t touch.”         |

## North Korea: MHD dynamos and TWSC

### Status summary

- There is **no reliable, detailed public evidence** that North Korea is pursuing:
  - MHD dynamos for power generation, or
  - Thermochemical water splitting cycles for hydrogen production.

Most open‑source information on North Korea’s energy system focuses on:

- Conventional **thermal power plants** (coal, oil)
- **Hydropower**
- Limited **nuclear** capability (Yongbyon) for weapons and possibly some power
- Chronic **electricity shortages**

### Likely constraints

- Limited access to:
  - High‑temperature materials
  - Advanced instrumentation
  - International collaboration
- Strong focus on:
  - Military nuclear program
  - Basic grid reliability

Any advanced MHD or TWSC work, if it exists, would almost certainly be **classified and not visible** in open literature.

title: "Hydrogen vs Carbon Energy in Fossil Hydrocarbons"
layout: post
description: "Ranking fossil hydrocarbons by hydrogen vs carbon energy contribution, with tables and engineering-grade analysis."
tags: [energy, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, carbon, thermodynamics]

# Hydrogen vs. Carbon Energy in Fossil Hydrocarbons

Understanding how much of a fossil fuel’s energy comes from **hydrogen** versus **carbon** is essential when evaluating ideas like *in‑situ hydrogen extraction* (splitting hydrocarbons underground and discarding carbon at the source).

Hydrogen releases far more energy per kilogram than carbon:

- **Hydrogen:** ~142 MJ/kg  
- **Carbon:** ~33 MJ/kg  

Hydrogen delivers **4.3× more energy per kg** than carbon.  
So fuels with higher **H:C ratios** deliver more energy from hydrogen.

---

## 1. Hydrogen‑to‑Carbon Ratios of Major Fossil Fuels

| Fuel Type | Typical Formula | H:C Ratio (molar) | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Anthracite coal | ~C₁H₀.₅ | ~0.5:1 | Extremely carbon‑heavy |
| Bituminous coal | ~C₁H₀.8 | ~0.8:1 | Still carbon‑dominant |
| Heavy crude | ~C₁H₁.4 | ~1.4:1 | More hydrogen, still carbon‑rich |
| Light crude | ~C₁H₁.8 | ~1.8:1 | Hydrogen‑richer |
| Diesel | C₁₂H₂₆ | 2.17:1 | High hydrogen |
| Gasoline | C₈H₁₈ | 2.25:1 | High hydrogen |
| Methane (natural gas) | CH₄ | 4:1 | Extremely hydrogen‑rich |

---

## 2. Energy Contribution: Hydrogen vs. Carbon

Using standard heats of combustion, we can estimate the **percentage of total energy** that comes from hydrogen vs. carbon.

### Ranked from MOST hydrogen‑dominated to MOST carbon‑dominated

| Rank | Fuel | % Energy from Hydrogen | % Energy from Carbon |
|------|------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Methane (natural gas) | ~55–60% | ~40–45% |
| 2 | Gasoline | ~47–50% | ~50–53% |
| 3 | Diesel | ~45–48% | ~52–55% |
| 4 | Light crude oil | ~40–45% | ~55–60% |
| 5 | Heavy crude oil | ~30–40% | ~60–70% |
| 6 | Bituminous coal | ~10–20% | ~80–90% |
| 7 | Anthracite coal | ~5–10% | ~90–95% |

---

## 3. Suitability for “Hydrogen at the Source” Extraction

Some hydrogen advocates propose splitting hydrocarbons underground (oil sands, coal seams, gas reservoirs) and extracting only the hydrogen.

Effectiveness depends entirely on the fuel’s hydrogen content.

| Fuel | Suitability | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Methane | **Excellent** | Very high H:C ratio; minimal carbon waste |
| Gasoline‑range hydrocarbons | **Good** | High hydrogen content |
| Diesel‑range hydrocarbons | **Moderate** | Still hydrogen‑rich |
| Light crude | **Moderate** | Significant carbon loss if discarded |
| Heavy crude | **Poor** | Too carbon‑rich; most energy lost |
| Bituminous coal | **Very poor** | Almost all energy is carbon |
| Anthracite coal | **Extremely poor** | Nearly pure carbon |

---

## 4. Bottom‑Line Ranking for Hydrogen Extraction Efficiency

From **best** to **worst** if your goal is to *discard carbon and keep hydrogen energy*:

1. **Natural gas (methane)**
2. **Gasoline‑range hydrocarbons**
3. **Diesel‑range hydrocarbons**
4. **Light crude oil**
5. **Heavy crude oil**
6. **Bituminous coal**
7. **Anthracite coal**

---

## 5. Core Conclusion

Discarding carbon at the source is only energetically sensible for **hydrogen‑rich fuels**.

- For **methane**, it works well — you keep most of the energy.  
- For **crude oil**, you lose a large fraction of the energy.  
- For **coal**, the idea is essentially non‑viable — almost all the energy is in the carbon you would be throwing away.
