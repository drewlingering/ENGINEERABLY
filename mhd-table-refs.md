### Fuel-agnostic biofuel matrix

| Fuel family        | Typical examples                                           | Physical / thermal behaviour                                                                 | Relative energy density | Ash / residue behaviour                                      | Emissions profile (qualitative)                                                                 | Commercial niches / feedstock sources                                                                 | Suitability in fuel‑agnostic device                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lignocellulosic    | Wood chips, pellets, sawdust, straw, husks, stalks, miscanthus, switchgrass | Chars and gasifies under heat; behaves like a solid; moisture strongly affects ignition and stability | Medium–high             | Moderate ash; can form clinker if minerals (e.g. silica, alkali) are high                        | Smoke and particulates if wet or under‑aired; NOₓ from high‑temp zones; generally low sulphur       | Forestry residues, sawmills, timber yards, farms, energy crops                                       | Very good: matches “slow‑pyrolysis/char + vapour” pattern; needs ash handling and moisture tolerance |
| Hemicellulosic     | Corn stover, bagasse, soft crop residues                  | Decomposes at lower temperatures; releases volatiles early; less dense, more friable         | Medium                  | Often higher ash than clean wood; ash is lighter and more easily entrained in flue gas           | Higher fine particulates; can smoke if under‑fired; still generally low sulphur                     | Sugar mills, grain farms, bioethanol plants, agro‑processing                                         | Good: easy to devolatilise; device must manage light, fluffy fuel and higher fly‑ash                 |
| Lignin‑rich        | Bark, paper‑mill residues, dried black liquor solids      | Resinous/tarry behaviour; high aromatic content; chars strongly; closer to tar than to clean wood | Medium–high             | Can produce sticky deposits; slagging and fouling risk on hot surfaces                           | Dense smoke if poorly burned; higher PAH content; still often lower sulphur than fossil tars        | Pulp & paper industry, sawmills, forestry processing                                                 | Very good conceptually: behaviour similar to bitumen/tar; needs good high‑temp zone and cleaning     |
| Lipid‑based (solid/semi‑solid) | Waste cooking fats, tallow, palm stearin, solid algal lipids | Melt → flow → vaporise → burn; at ambient may be waxy or solid; needs pre‑heating for consistency | High                    | Low ash; main issue is soot and deposits from incomplete vaporisation                            | Can be smoky and sooty if not fully vaporised; low ash but high unburned HC risk if mishandled      | Food industry, restaurants, slaughterhouses, biodiesel side‑streams, algae facilities                | Strong fit: device already contemplates viscous/tarry feeds; needs controlled melt and vapour phase  |
| Processed biomass (torrefied, briquettes, biochar) | Torrefied pellets, densified briquettes, biochar, “bio‑coal” | Stable, coal‑like; high fixed carbon; predictable grind/size; burns like low‑grade coal       | Medium–high             | Ash depends on source; torrefied fuels often have manageable ash; biochar leaves significant char | Particulates and NOₓ similar to low‑grade coal if over‑fired; sulphur usually lower than fossil coal | Biomass processing plants, waste‑to‑energy, carbon‑negative projects, rural fuel producers           | Excellent: uniform, predictable, easy to feed; ideal for commercialisation as a “universal” solid fuel |
| Digestate solids & mixed residues | Dried digestate, manure solids, mixed organic waste fractions | Moisture highly variable; can behave like low‑grade biomass/peat; may cake or crust          | Low–medium              | Often high ash; risk of slagging and fouling; mineral content highly variable                    | Higher particulates; odour compounds; NOₓ and some acid gases depending on composition              | Biogas plants, farms, municipal organic waste streams                                                | Possible but challenging: device must be tolerant of high ash, variable quality, and fouling         |
| Bitumen‑like / tarry bio‑residues | Lignin concentrates, pitch, heavy biorefinery residues       | Semi‑solid or viscous; softens then flows; slow to ignite; decomposes to vapours + coke      | High                    | Coke/char formation; sticky deposits; requires robust hot‑surface and cleaning strategy          | Heavy smoke and soot if under‑aired; high PAH content; low ash but dirty flue gas if mishandled     | Advanced biorefineries, pulp/paper, specialty chemical plants                                       | Very strong conceptual match: same handling class as bituminous oil sands; needs high‑temp, staged air |

### Economic and environmental positioning (summary layer)

| Fuel family        | Cost / availability pattern                          | Key environmental upside                                              | Key environmental risk / constraint                                      | Commercial pitch for a fuel‑agnostic device                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lignocellulosic    | Widely available; often low‑cost or waste‑cost      | Displaces fossil fuels; can be near‑carbon‑neutral if sustainably sourced | Land‑use and biodiversity if over‑harvested; local air quality if poorly burned | “Turn local wood and crop residues into reliable heat without needing refined fuels.”       |
| Hemicellulosic     | Abundant agro‑residue; often a disposal problem     | Converts waste into energy; reduces open‑burning of residues           | Seasonal availability; logistics and storage; dust and particulates       | “Monetise crop residues and mill waste in a flexible, robust heat system.”                  |
| Lignin‑rich        | Concentrated in specific industries; low or negative value | Uses difficult industrial by‑products; reduces waste treatment burden   | Localised emissions if not well controlled; sticky deposits               | “Recover energy from lignin‑rich by‑products your current boilers can’t easily handle.”     |
| Lipid‑based        | Clustered around food and processing hubs           | Avoids dumping fats/oils; high energy density per unit mass            | If poorly managed, odour and smoke; upstream land‑use (e.g. palm) issues  | “Convert waste fats and solid oils into clean, controllable process heat.”                  |
| Processed biomass  | Manufactured fuels; higher price but predictable    | Enables high‑efficiency, low‑emission biomass systems                  | Energy and cost to process; feedstock sourcing still matters              | “Drop‑in solid fuel for multi‑fuel devices—predictable, easy to ship and store.”            |
| Digestate & mixed  | Very low or negative cost; disposal challenge       | Closes nutrient and carbon loops; reduces landfill and open dumping    | High ash, odour, variable composition; potential contaminants             | “Turn problematic digestate and organic residues into usable heat with tolerant hardware.”  |
| Bitumen‑like bio‑residues | Niche, site‑specific; often a liability to dispose of | Converts hazardous or awkward residues into energy under controlled conditions | High PAH and smoke risk if mishandled; requires strong governance         | “Specialist capability: safely utilise tarry bio‑residues that others can’t touch.”         |

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Thermal envelope         | Must tolerate fuels that melt, char, gasify, or behave like tar; wide operating temperature window      | Document as “wide thermal operating range; suitable for solid and semi‑solid fuels.”   |
| Air management           | Staged, controllable air supply to handle early volatiles and late char oxidation                       | Describe as “multi‑stage air path for complete combustion of diverse bio‑feedstocks.”  |
| Residence time           | Sufficient hot‑zone residence time for slow‑burning vapours and chars                                   | Phrase as “extended residence time for low‑grade and high‑volatility fuels.”          |
| Ash and deposit handling | Robust ash path; access for cleaning; tolerance of slagging/fouling in high‑ash or tarry fuels          | “Designed for high‑ash and deposit‑forming fuels; serviceable without specialist tools.” |

| Emissions control        | Conceptual provision for particulate reduction and cleaner stack (baffles, filters, scrubber options)   | “Compatible with add‑on flue‑gas cleaning modules for stricter air‑quality regimes.”   |
| Control philosophy       | Focus on stability and tolerance rather than razor‑edge efficiency for a single fuel                    | “Optimised for robustness and fuel flexibility over single‑fuel peak efficiency.”      |
