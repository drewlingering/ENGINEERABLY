## Field definitions

- **Name / Concept ID:**  
  Official name of the aircraft or project, or a stable label you assign.

- **Type / Role:**  
  e.g. *eVTOL air taxi, personal flyer, RC jet, business jet, glider, concept airliner*.

- **Propulsion / Power:**  
  e.g. *electric, hybrid‑electric, hydrogen, turbofan, micro‑turbine, piston*.

- **Notable Features:**  
  Short, operationally useful description (e.g. *tilt‑rotor, ducted fans, autonomous, STOL, lifting body*).

- **Timestamp:**  
  `mm:ss` or `hh:mm:ss` position in the YouTube video for quick reference.

- **External Link:**  
  Official site, spec sheet, or manufacturer page (not the YouTube link).

## How to extend

- **Add one row per craft** as you identify it in the video.
- If multiple variants of the same platform appear, either:
  - give each its own row, or  
  - group them under one name and note variants in **Notable Features**.
- If a concept is unnamed in the video, assign a stable internal ID (e.g. `Concept-01 eVTOL Wingless Taxi`) and refine later.
