## ❄️ Wind farms built on permafrost or continuous frozen ground

1. **Pilgrim Hot Springs Wind Project – Alaska, USA**  
   - **Location:** Seward Peninsula region  
   - **Ground conditions:** Discontinuous permafrost  
   - **Foundation approach:** Elevated pile foundations and thermal protection  
   - **Role:** Remote community power for the Nome region  

2. **Kotzebue Wind Farm – Alaska, USA**  
   - **Notes:** One of the earliest Arctic wind farms  
   - **Ground conditions:** Continuous permafrost  
   - **Foundation approach:** Deep steel piles and ventilated foundations  
   - **Environment:** Operates in −40°C conditions with freeze–thaw risk  

3. **Toksook Bay Wind Farm – Alaska, USA**  
   - **Community:** Remote Yup’ik community  
   - **Ground conditions:** Ice‑rich permafrost  
   - **Foundation approach:** Thermosyphon‑stabilised pads  

4. **Nunavut community wind installations – Canada**  
   - **Example locations:**  
     - Rankin Inlet  
     - Kugluktuk  
     - Cambridge Bay  
   - **Ground conditions:** Continuous permafrost  
   - **Foundation approach:**  
     - Insulated gravel pads  
     - Passive cooling systems  
     - Elevated structures  

5. **Inuvik Wind Project – Northwest Territories, Canada**  
   - **Ground conditions:** Ice‑rich permafrost slopes  
   - **Foundation approach:** Rock pad foundation with thermal protection  
   - **Notes:** One of the most technically challenging Arctic wind installations  

## 🧊 Seasonally frozen ground (not full permafrost) but still requiring special design

6. **Inner Mongolia wind farms – China**  
   - **Ground conditions:** Seasonally frozen ground over large areas  
   - **Foundation considerations:**  
     - Frost‑heave mitigation  
     - Deep piles  
     - Insulated collars  

7. **Northern Sweden & Finland (Lapland) onshore wind farms**  
   - **Ground conditions:** Deep seasonal freezing for several months  
   - **Foundation considerations:**  
     - Deep piles  
     - Frost‑protected shallow foundations  
     - Insulated pads  
   - **Example sites:**  
     - Markbygden Wind Farm (Sweden)  
     - Tervola installations (Finland)  
     - Keminmaa installations (Finland)
