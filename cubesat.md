# 🛰️ Privately Funded CubeSat Launches by Individuals

This document catalogs real-world examples of **private individuals or small teams** who have successfully launched CubeSats using **personal savings**, **donations**, or **crowdfunding**, without institutional or government funding.

## 🚀 Overview

CubeSats are small, modular satellites (typically 1U = 10×10×10 cm) that can be launched into orbit via **rideshare programs**. While kits like *MySat* or *PocketQube* are affordable for hobbyists, **orbital deployment** still requires significant funding and regulatory compliance.

## 💸 Typical Cost Breakdown (1U CubeSat)

| Item                     | Estimated Cost (GBP) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| CubeSat hardware kit     | £5,000–£15,000       |
| Testing & integration    | £5,000–£10,000       |
| Launch (rideshare slot)  | £20,000–£80,000+     |
| Licensing & insurance    | £5,000–£15,000       |
| **Total**                | **£35,000–£120,000+**|

> ⚠️ Note: These figures are conservative estimates. Costs vary based on orbit, payload mass, and launch provider.

## 🧠 Key Considerations

- **Launch Access**: Most individuals use **rideshare brokers** (e.g., SpaceX Rideshare, Exolaunch, Nanoracks).
- **Regulatory Compliance**:
  - **Frequency licensing** (e.g., Ofcom, ITU)
  - **Launch approvals** (e.g., UK Civil Aviation Authority)
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Radiation-tolerant electronics
  - Thermal and power management
  - Attitude control (if needed for pointing or imaging)
- **Open-Source Ecosystem**:
  - [LibreCube](https://librecube.net/)
  - [SatNOGS](https://satnogs.org/)
  - [PocketQube Shop](https://www.pocketqubeshop.com/)

## 🌍 Trends Enabling Individuals

- **PocketQubes** (smaller than CubeSats) reduce launch mass and cost.
- **Crowdfunding** (e.g., Kickstarter) has enabled several successful missions.
- **Educational kits** like *MySat* and *PiSat* allow prototyping and testing on Earth.
