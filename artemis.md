## NASA Spaceflight (NSF)

**Role:** High‑fidelity coverage of **SLS Block 1**, **core stage**, **SRBs**, **ICPS**, **Orion**, and **ground systems**.

**Why it’s in the list:**

- Tracks **integration milestones**, **Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB)** work, and **rollout/Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR)** for Artemis II.
- Provides detailed commentary on **pad 39B operations**, **countdown procedures**, and **launch commit criteria**.
- Uses engineering diagrams, insider reporting, and long‑form livestreams to document operational reality.

**Best use case:** When you want to follow **what is happening to the actual stack**—rollout dates, WDR, hardware status, and risk‑relevant milestones.

---

## Everyday Astronaut

**Role:** Deep‑dive explainers on **rocket architecture**, **engine cycles**, and **mission sequencing**.

**Why it’s in the list:**

- Breaks down complex systems like **RS‑25 engines**, **solid rocket boosters**, and **upper stages** in accessible but technically accurate language.
- Compares SLS/Orion to other architectures (e.g., Starship, Falcon Heavy) to contextualise Artemis II.
- Uses detailed charts, animations, and interviews with industry figures.

**Best use case:** When you want to understand **how SLS and Orion work as machines**—propulsion, staging, and performance envelopes.

---

## Marcus House

**Role:** Weekly, technically literate updates on **Artemis program status**, including Artemis II.

**Why it’s in the list:**

- Covers **NASA SLS and Orion** alongside commercial programs, with clear attention to **mission timelines** and **hardware readiness**.
- Tracks **integration progress**, **testing campaigns**, and **schedule risk** for Artemis II.
- Maintains a dedicated space‑focused platform with ongoing coverage of beyond‑LEO missions.

**Best use case:** When you want **regular situational awareness** on Artemis II—what changed this week, what hardware moved, what milestones were hit.

---

## Scott Manley

**Role:** Explains **orbital mechanics** and **mission design** with mathematical and historical grounding.

**Why it’s in the list:**

- Ideal for understanding **free‑return trajectories**, **delta‑v budgets**, and **lunar flyby geometry** in the context of Artemis II.
- Frequently compares modern missions to **Apollo‑era flights**, giving operational context for Artemis II’s flight profile.
- Bridges the gap between “space news” and **actual mission design logic**.

**Best use case:** When you want to know **why Artemis II flies the way it does**, not just that it flies.

---

## Digital Astronaut

**Role:** Structured technical explainers on **Artemis II mission flow**, **crew systems**, and **onboard operations**.

**Why it’s in the list:**

- Produces videos like **“Artemis II Explained | 2026 Mission to the Moon”**, walking through **mission phases**, **crew tasks**, and **system roles**.
- Focuses on **life‑support**, **exercise hardware**, **radiation protocols**, and **crew‑facing systems**.
- Good balance between accessibility and operational detail.

**Best use case:** When you want a **mission‑timeline‑centric** view—what the crew does, when, and with which systems.

---

## NASA Artemis content (official)

**Role:** Primary source for **verified technical data**, **mission objectives**, and **crew information**.

**Key resources:**

- **NASA Artemis II milestones article**—details rollout, WDR, and launch‑prep milestones for the crewed SLS/Orion flight.
- **NASA “Curious Universe” Artemis II podcast series**—five‑part companion podcast with astronaut interviews and behind‑the‑scenes operational context.

**Why it’s in the list:**

- Defines the **official mission architecture**, objectives, and constraints.
- Provides authoritative descriptions of **Artemis II’s role** as the first crewed SLS/Orion lunar flyby and precursor to Artemis III.
- Anchors all third‑party analysis in **primary documentation**.

**Best use case:** When you need **canonical wording** for public‑facing docs, or to cross‑check vlog claims against NASA’s own descriptions.

## How to use this list operationally

- **For propulsion and vehicle architecture:** Start with **Everyday Astronaut** and **NASA Spaceflight**.
- **For program status and schedule:** Track **Marcus House** and **NASA Spaceflight** milestones.
- **For mission design and trajectories:** Use **Scott Manley** as your orbital mechanics lens.
- **For crew operations and systems:** Use **Digital Astronaut** plus NASA’s Artemis II podcast series.
- **For authoritative baselines:** Always cross‑reference with **NASA Artemis articles and podcasts**.
